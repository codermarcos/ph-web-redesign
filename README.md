set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>"
set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<AWS REGION TO DEPLOY (Recomended: 'sa-east-1' to Production & 'us-east-2' to Development)>"
```

To windows:

```bash
$Env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<YOUR ACCESS KEY ID AWS>"
$Env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>"
$Env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<AWS REGION TO DEPLOY (Recomended: 'sa-east-1' to Production & 'us-east-2' to Development)>"
